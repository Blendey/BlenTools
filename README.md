# BlenTools
An add-on for Blender, with various macro's/presets to speed up your character design workflow.
The add-on includes little features, like seperating vertex groups from your mesh and storing them in your file, or a quick IK bone setup. A guide for using the add-on is worked on. The add-on is still very new, and most features are not ready yet.
